# DnD: Quest for Glory!

# User Story



# Concept:
We will allow a user to create thrilling stories with tales beyond your wildest dreams! Choose your class, race, equipment to bring along, and what monsters you want to take down!

Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

Coming up with a new, creative character and storyline for your next Dungeons & Dragons campaign can be the most frustrating part of the game. Using cutting edge AI technology, itâ€™s now never been easier to create a unique character and brainstorm a story. Simply randomize character traits and generate a unique and exciting story. 

To generate short stories based upon selections made without having to actually play the game in it's traditional form within a group setting and dice.

# How to Use

You may start by entering a name (optional) and then using the randomize buttons to set Race(required), Trait, Class, Skill, Equipment and Monster (to battle against) and then select Generate Story to get your hero's story along with a picture and option to save for future reference.
